## Executive Summary
Members of Parliament (MP, in German: Mitglieder des Bundestags, MdB) are 
elected to represent, and act on behalf of the people living in Germany. 
Their work as elected representatives is paid for by taxes raised by the federal 
government.  It seems only fair therefore to ask how seriously they take their responsibilities.

My analysis is focused on the 19th legislative period of the Bundestag, which 
ran from `r sStartDate` to `r sEndDate`.  I show that overall attendance was 
high, but that there were significant differences between parties, as well as 
for party leaders and government ministers.

I chose to adress the question whether a no-show vote can be predicted, by 
answering two questions in particular:

  1. for any given MP and poll, is it possible to predict whether this MP is 
  going to no-show at the poll?  
  2. (supplementary question) is it possible to predict which MPs are most 
  likely to be a frequent no-show?

I found that while it is possible to make some predictions for MPs no-show 
behaviour, this requires costly trade-offs between precision (a combination of 
MP and poll correctly identified as a no-show) and recall (share of all no-shows 
identified). Furthermore, I also found that knowledge of which MPs are most 
likely to no-show (i.e. question 2) does not add sufficient predictive power to 
be worth the effort.

Future work in this area would benefit from a deeper investigation of MP's 2^nd^
jobs (i.e. outside of parliament) as well as a more detailed review of MPs 
motivations, i.e. they may not expect a continued career in parliament.


## Introduction
For this final capstone assignment of the HarvardX Data Science Professional 
Certificate Programme, I chose to review attendance in the German federal 
parliament ('Bundestag') during the recently ended 19th legislative period. 
The 19th legislative period of the Bundestag began on `r sStartDate` and ended 
with the constituent meeting of the newly elected MPs on `r sEndDate`.

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

The 19th Bundestag was constituted of 7(6)^[CDU and CSU are separate parties but 
stand in elections - and sit in parliament as joint parliamentary groups] 
parties: CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Die GrÃ¼nen, Die Linke, AfD.

While key debates and votes are generally covered in some depth in the media, 
much less visibility is given to the level of attendance / absences in 
parliament. Only keen observers of contemporary news reporting would notice 
that, quite frequently, parliamentary debates are attended only by a smaller 
number of MPs.

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r image1, out.width = "5cm", image.cap="Composition of parliament by party"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sComposition of parliament.jpg", 
                         opts_chunk$get("fig.path")))
```

::::::::::::::

As we will see below, absences at votes are common. Many reasons may be behind 
this - illness, obligations as government minister, etc..  However, no further 
details are given as of the time of this report.

Interestingly there is also a noticeable proportion of votes that are 'no 
shows', i.e. absences without explanation from the MP.

To the best of my knowledge, no systematic analysis of the patterns of 
attendance in parliament has been done.  This appears to be a significant 
omission: participating in the parliamentary debate is a key task for MPs and 
signals their awareness of and support for the rules and principles of 
parliamentary democracy.

The data for this assignment comes from abgeordnetenwatch.de, which was set up 
to offers an API to access data on politicians, members of parliament, 
parliamentary periods, motions and votes, and committee memberships in detail 
and going back `r dictKeyStats['numPeriodsInAPI']` parliamentary periods to `r dictKeyStats['earliestParliament'] %>% as_date() %>% format('%Y')`.


## The data

The data for this project is available via an API by [https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/api](abgeordnetenwatch.de). This API is based 
on HTTP GET requests to API URLs that reference specific data entities:

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}

```

The entities marked with (*) are used in my analysis.

Additionally, there are two additional datasets that I draw on:
1. a file with geometric shape data: I use this to draw a map of voting 
districts
2. a mapping of voting districts codes and IDs

## ETL approach and scripts

I created a number of R files for this project, each for specific steps in the 
process:

```{r table2, echo=FALSE}
mytable = data.frame(
    File     = c('00 Setup.R',
                 '01 GetData.R',
                 '02 TidyData.R',
                 '103 Initial exploration.R',
                 '104 Predictions v2.R',
                 '19 Report.Rmd'),
    Purpose = c('* Downloads a LUA filter script to facilitate multi-column R
                report creation',
                '* Retrieve data from the abgeordnetenwatch API.  Implements a 
                multi-stage caching of interim files to minimse API load',
                '* Reformatting and cleaning: the raw data retrieved from 
                abgeordnetenwatch is - depending on the entity - deeply nested 
                and not directly usable for analysis.  Type-casting to ensure 
                consistency and facilitate analysis (e.g. dates)',
                '* Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Reviews and analyses the 
                data downloaded from abgeordnetenwatch and draws out key 
                insights',
                '* Machine learning: Attempts to predict which MPs are most 
                likely to have a high(-er) share of no-show votes.  Attempts to 
                predict which polls an MP will no-show.',
                '* This report'))

pander(mytable,
       keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Key R files')
```

These draw on a small number of common helper files, namely:

```{r table3, echo=FALSE}
mytable = data.frame(
    File     = c('Definitions.R',
                 'Settings.R',
                 'getJSON.R',
                 'SupportFunctions.R',
                 'Colours.R',
                 'VotePie.R'),
    Purpose = c('Common constants and definitions, e.g. folder names',
                'Global variables and settings',
                'Retrieve (multi-page) JSON data',
                'Other (additional) supporting functions',
                'Standard colours to use for each of the parties and their
                parliamentary groups (\'Fraktionen\')',
                'Draw two-level donut / pie charts'))

pander(mytable,
       keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Supporting functionality')
```

\newpage

### Extract: data retrieval

The process of data collection is structured as follows:  `01 GetData.R` starts 
by retrieving the ID for the current parliamentary period of the Federal 
parliament (`Bundestag`), and then proceeds to download data on MPs of the 
current parliament (`CandidacyMandate`), details for each MP (`Politicians`), 
parliamentary committees and their members (`Committee` and 
`CommitteeMembership`), parties and fractions (`Party` and `Fraction`), and 
finally voting data (`Polls` and `Topic` as well as `Vote`).

To avoid unnecessary API requests, `01 GetData.R` uses the `getJSON()` helper 
function  (provided in `GetJSON.R`) that requires a filename, a directory path, 
and an API URL. It uses these inputs to then check whether the relevant data has 
already been downloaded (in which case it would open the relevant file and 
return its content), or retrieve the API result from that URL and store it in a 
file. Either way, `getJSON()` returns the requested data. In cases where the API 
response indicates that more results are available than have been returned 
(paged data), `getJSON()` repeats the API call with `&page=` and a page number 
appended to each call until all results have been obtained.  Finally, 
`01 GetData.R`  writes the collected data to storage as serialised R objects .

``` {r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Get a reference to the federal parliament ('Bundestag')
print('Fetching reference to current parliamentary period\n')
parliamentsAPI <- c(name = 'parliaments.JSON',
                    url = 'https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/api/v2/parliaments')
parliaments <- getJSON(parliamentsAPI['name'],
                       parliamentsAPI['url'],
                       path = folderJSON)
BundestagID <- parliaments[parliaments["label"] == "Bundestag",]$id
currentBundestagID <- parliaments[parliaments["id"] == BundestagID,]$current_project$id
  
# Get a list of all parliamentary periods for the federal parliament available
# via this API
print('Getting list of earlier parliamentary periods\n')
PeriodsAPI <- c(
  name = 'periods.JSON',
  url = paste0(
    'https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/api/v2/parliament-periods?parliament=',
    BundestagID
  )
)
Periods <- getJSON(PeriodsAPI['name'],
                   PeriodsAPI['url'],
                   path = folderJSON)
save(Periods, file = paste0(folderRData, 'Periods-RAW.RData'))

previousBundestagID <- Periods[Periods$type == 'legislature',] %>%
  slice(2) %>%
  pull('id')

# Get a list of all Members of Parliament in the previous legislative period
print('Downloading list of MPs\n')
MPsAPI <- c(
  name = 'mps.JSON',
  url = paste0(
    'https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/api/v2/candidacies-mandates?parliament_period=',
    previousBundestagID
  )
)
MPs <- getJSON(MPsAPI['name'],
               MPsAPI['url'],
               path = folderJSON)
save(MPs, file = paste0(folderRData, 'MPs-RAW.RData'))
```


### Transform: data cleaning
Data cleaning primarily takes place in `02 TidyData.R`.  The script first 
retrieves the downloaded raw API data from file and unpacks and unnests all 
columns that contain a data.frame or a list. The script then converts columns 
containing dates to Date format, and all columns containing IDs to numeric.

Following this, the script creates a few additional columns (such as age, 
derived from year of birth) that will be needed in subsequent analyses.

Finally, I create stripped-down 'skeleton' versions of certain datasets that 
contain only the core columns required for linking between entities. While this 
appeared useful at the beginning, I ended up making less use of it than I 
thought.

The tidied and stripped-down data frames are saved back to disk as RData files. 
The code snippet below illustrates this process using the example of the 
`CandidacyMandate` entity.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
load(file = paste0(folderRData, 'MPs-RAW.RData'))
MPs <- MPs %>% unpack(c(parliament_period, politician, electoral_data),
                      names_sep = '.')
MPs <- MPs %>% unpack(c(electoral_data.electoral_list,
                        electoral_data.constituency),
                      names_sep = '.')
MPs <- MPs %>% unnest('fraction_membership', names_sep = ".", keep_empty = TRUE)
MPs <- MPs %>% unpack('fraction_membership.fraction', names_sep = ".")
MPs$start_date <- as.Date(MPs$start_date)
MPs$end_date <- as.Date(MPs$end_date)
MPs <- MPs %>% mutate_if((str_detect(names(.), "id$")), as.numeric)
save(MPs, file = paste0(folderRData, 'MPs.RData'))

skMPs <- MPs %>% select(id, label, politician.id, politician.label, 
                        electoral_data.id, electoral_data.electoral_list.id, 
                        electoral_data.constituency.id, fraction_membership.id, 
                        fraction_membership.fraction.id, start_date, end_date)
save(skMPs, file = paste0(folderRData, 'skMPs.RData'))
rm(list = c('MPs', 'skMPs'))
```

## Exploratory analysis

Members of Parliament (MP, in German: Mitglied des Bundestags, MdB) are elected 
to represent and act on behalf of the people living in Germany.  It seems fair 
to ask how seriously they take their responsibilities.

In this analysis, we need to exclude those persons who are no longer in 
parliament, e.g. because of illness or death. A Google search with their name 
usually provides context for readers who are curious for more background, but 
this is not relevant here.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
inactiveMPs <- skMPs %>%
  filter(!is.na(end_date)) %>% 
  select('id')
```

I investigate how attendance of MPs remaining active for the entire legislative 
period has developed over the course of the 19th parliament.  I then also look at absenteeism by gender, age, tenure, party membership, MP's 'security' in their 
seat (i.e. popular support in their constituency), and topic of each motion voted 
on by parliament.

### Overall attendance
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}

Overall attendance at parliamentary debates is high, with - on average `r 
percent(1 - dictKeyStats['ShareNoShowActive'])` participation in votes.  This 
average hides significant differences between MPs, parties, and over time. 
Looking at the frequency distribution of no-shows, let's focus on those MPs that 
have a no-show share larger than `r percent(dictKeyStats['cutoffMissedVotes'], 
accuracy=1)`.
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}

```{r image2, out.width = "5cm", image.cap="Share of no-show votes"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sno-show share of votes.jpg", 
                         opts_chunk$get("fig.path")))
```

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
```{r image3, out.width = "5cm", image.cap="Frequency of no-show votes"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sFrequency of no-show votes by MP.jpg", 
                         opts_chunk$get("fig.path")))
```
:::
::::::::::::::

### Drill-down into attendance by MP
1. As becomes immediately apparent, government ministers have a higher share of
missed votes than most MPs:

```{r table4, echo=FALSE}
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41603209/pander-control-column-width

load(file=paste0(folderTemp, 'List of top NS MPs.RData'))
topNSMPs %>%
  mutate('Name'=politician.label,
         'Occupation'=occupation,
         'Party'=party.label,
         'Share of polls missed'=percent(missedVotes, accuracy=1)) %>%
  select(c('Name', 'Occupation', 'Party', 'Share of polls missed')) %>%
pander(keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Top MPs by absence')
```

The top 'no-shows' are headed (appropriately?) by the Head of Government,
Chancellor Angela Merkel.  #2 on the list is Dr. Helge Braun which a quick Google
search identifies as Head of the Chancellery and Federal Minister for Special
Affairs.  Fifth is Peter Altmeier, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and
Energy.


:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

2. More than half of all no-show MPs are from fringe parties on either the left
or the right of the political spectrum, or from MPs no longer affiliated with
any party.  Let's look at their characteristics in a bit more detail.

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r image4, out.width = "5 cm", image.cap='Share of no-show votes by party'}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sShare of no-show votes by party.jpg", opts_chunk$get("fig.path")))
```

:::
::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

3. I wanted to see _where_ these MPs' constituencies were - whether there was any
discernable regional pattern.  And, to be honest, I also wanted to find out how 
to create maps in R.  It turns out to be a lot easier than I thought. 



:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r image5, out.width = "7 cm"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sConstituency map.jpg", opts_chunk$get("fig.path")))
```

:::
::::::::::::::

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# QUESTION Where are they from?
load(paste0(folderRData, 'constituencies.RData'))
shpConstituencies <- st_read(paste0(folderTemp,
                                    'Geometrie_Wahlkreise_19DBT_VG250.shp'))

nsConstituencies <- shpConstituencies %>%
  left_join(constituencies, by=c('WKR_NR' = 'number')) %>%
  left_join(nsMPs, by=c('id' = 'electoral_data.constituency.id')) %>%
  select(c('politician.label', 'geometry', 'isNS'))

nsConstituencies[is.na(nsConstituencies$isNS), 'isNS'] <- FALSE

gMap <- nsConstituencies %>% ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=isNS), size=0.1) +
  coord_sf(label_axes='') + 
  scale_fill_manual('No-show MP constituency',
                    values=colHighlight2,
                    limits=c(TRUE), 
                    labels=c('No-show constituency')) +
  ggtitle('MP constituencies') +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        legend.position='bottom',
        legend.title=element_blank())

ggsave(plot=gMap, width=7, height=7, units='cm', dpi='print', path=folderImages, 
       filename='Constituency map.jpg')
```

4. Next, I took a look at the power base of each of these MPs.  My hypothesis
was that, given a stronger position within the party or their constituency, MPs
would be more likely to have a higher share of 'no-shows' for two reasons:

  + There should be higher demand on their time from either party or government
  offices
  + There should be less pressure to show engagement 

As the images below illustrate, there is only limited support for my hypothesis:
stronger constituency results _tend to_ be associated with a higher share of no-
shows, but overall there are only few differences between the more and less
active MPs along this dimension.  


```{r image Power base.jpg, out.width = "15cm", image.cap = "caption"}

5. Finally, let's look at their demographics (age, gender).  Again there seem to
be only minor differences between those MPs who attend most polls, and those who
are more likely to be absent: `r percent(dictKeyStats['m-TRUE'], accuracy=0.1)` 
of male and `r percent(dictKeyStats['f-TRUE'], accuracy=0.1)` female MPs are 
(more) frequently absent at polls than their peers.

### Attendance by topic

In this section, I ask what, if anything, we can learn about the polls that have
the highest share of no-shows (i.e. topics, dates, # of polls on the day).  


To start, let's identify those polls that have the highest share of no-shows.  
As we have seen above, the average share of no-show votes across all polls is 
about `r percent(dictKeyStats['ShareNoShowActive'], accuracy=0.1)`.  I therefore 
now focus on polls where the share of no-show votes is above this threshold:

```{r code, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
skActiveVotes <- activeVotes %>%
  select(c('id', 'mandate.id', 'poll.id', 'vote'))

nsVotes <- skActiveVotes %>%
  group_by(poll.id, vote) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% ungroup() %>%
  group_by(poll.id) %>% mutate(N=sum(n), s=n/N) %>%
  filter(vote == 'no_show') %>% select(c('poll.id', 'n', 's'))

nsVoteIDs <- nsVotes %>% filter(s > 0.08) %>%
  select('poll.id')
```

::: {.column width="30%"}
6. The majority of polls is held on Thursdays and Fridays, i.e. at the end of 
the working week.  However, Fridays are also the weekday with the highest share 
of no-show votes.  This could at least in part be because Friday is likely to 
be seen as the start of the weekend by some MPs.  Note that there does not seem 
to be a strong effect of the # of polls per day on MPs attendance.
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r image No-shows by weekday.jpg, out.width = "10cm", image.cap = "Polls by weekday"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sNo-shows by weekday.jpg", opts_current$get("fig.path")))
```

7. Last but not least, I also investigated whether certain topics might result 
in a higher share of no-show votes.  As the graph (below) shows, procedural 
affairs, lobbyism and transparency are the areas most affected.  

```{r image No-show committees and topics.jpg, out.width = "14cm", image.cap = "Polls by committee / topic"}
include_graphics(sprintf("%sNo-show committees and topics.jpg", opts_current$get("fig.path")))
```

With this, I conclude the exploratory analysis.  The following section of this 
paper reports on my approach and results predicting no-show behaviour.

## Predicting no-show behaviour

I chose to focus on predicting no-show behaviour in the most recently 
completed parliamentary period.  Following the exploratory analysis above, I 
expect difficulties in getting strong prediction results.  I therefore decided 
to split the task into two questions:  

  1. predict for each MP whether they are likely to be a frequent no-show at 
  polls
  2. predict for each MP and each poll whether the MP is likely to vote 
  no-show

Step 1 would - that, at least was my plan - give me a valuable additional data 
point to work with for answering the second question. Unfortunately it turned 
out that such a no-show flag does not add sufficient additional data, and I 
ultimately discarded this approach in deriving my final result.

To facilitate the analysis, I created a function `doTestMethod()` which I call 
repeatedly with different parameters to split, train, and test a dataset, and 
that calculates precision + recall performance.  This function takes a number of 
inputs:

  * a dataframe with the data to run predictions on
  * a list of column names that contain the predictors
  * a charater string with the name of the column that is to be predicted
  * the name of the machine learning model to use
  * the name of the sampling method to use
  * a version tag number
  * an _optional_ list of parameters that is passed through to the training 
  function  

I `sapply` this function to a list containing parameter sets for sampling and 
training.  The output - a list of precision & recall results - is then stored 
for assessment and use in this report.  

By default, `doTestMethod()` stores the results of previous runs, and will 
draw on these if called again.  


### Predicting whether any given MP is likely to be a frequent no-show

Building on the exploratory analysis of the previous section, I flagged MPs with 
a share of no-show votes equal to or larger than 
`r percent(dictKeyStats['cutoffMissedVotes'], accuracy=1)` as `isNSMP`.  

The list of MPs was split into two equally sized training and testing sets. 
Given the small number of flagged MPs, sampling was critical to ensure balanced 
datasets for both training and testing.

My analysis showed that `up` worked best for this problem, and that no 
significant benefit was to be gained from switching to either `rose` or `smote` 
(in fact, using either caused problems with training in most cases). 
Unsurprisingly, downsampling did not perform as well since this resulted in a 
very small overall training / testing datasets.

I applied a range of different ML algorithms to the problem, and assessed both 
precision (the share of correctly identified no-show MPs in the total list of 
MPs predicted by the algorithm) and recall (the share of true no-show MPs 
identified by the algorithm).  

As the table below illustrates, results were not great:

```{r table5, echo=FALSE}
fName <- paste0(folderTemp, 'lConsolidatedResultsMPs.RData')
load(fName)
lConsolidatedResultsMPs['Precision',] <- 
  sapply(lConsolidatedResultsMPs['Precision',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
lConsolidatedResultsMPs['Recall',] <- 
  sapply(lConsolidatedResultsMPs['Recall',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
pander(lConsolidatedResultsMPs,
       keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Predicting which MPs are most likely to vote no-show')
```

### Predicting whether any given MP is likely to no-show for a given poll

I tested whether predicting a no-show vote (`isNSVote`) was feasible both with 
and without reference to the `isNSMP` flag that identifies those MPs  most likely 
to be a no-show.  My hope was that this flag would help in predicting no-show 
behaviour.

Unlike the MP dataset used so far, the poll and voting dataset includes a number 
of categorical predictors.  I 'one hot' encoded the relevant columns of the 
dataframe before running the training task.

  1. Prediction without the `isNS` flag  
  As in the previous section, I again tested a number of ML algorithms on this 
  problem. For the sake of limiting computing time, I however chose a reduced set 
  of methods: `glm`, `lda`, and `bayesglm`, all with `up` as sampling algorithm. 
  The table below summarises the results of this analysis:
  
```{r table6, echo=FALSE}
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)

load(file=paste0(folderTemp, 'lResultsVotes.RData'))
lResultsVotes['Precision',] <- 
  sapply(lResultsVotes['Precision',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
lResultsVotes['Recall',] <- 
  sapply(lResultsVotes['Recall',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
pander(lResultsVotes,
keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Predicting no-show voting behaviour')
```

  2. Prediction including reference to the  `isNSMP` flag  
  Surprisingly, adding the `isNSMP` flag for calling out those MPs most likely 
  to no-show at polls did not improve prediction performance.  I hypothesise 
  that the number of MPs identified with this flag is too small (or, in other 
  words: the number of no-show votes attributed to the `isNSMP` MPs is too 
  small) to make a big difference.
  
```{r table7, echo=FALSE}
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)

load(file=paste0(folderTemp, 'lResultsVotesEnhanced.RData'))
lResultsVotesEnhanced['Precision',] <- 
  sapply(lResultsVotesEnhanced['Precision',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
lResultsVotesEnhanced['Recall',] <- 
  sapply(lResultsVotesEnhanced['Recall',], function(x) 
    { percent(x, accuracy=0.1) })
pander(lResultsVotesEnhanced,
keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
       style = 'grid',
       justify = 'left',
       caption='Predicting no-show voting behaviour, with a flag for top no-show MPs')
```

## Summary and Conclusions

My analysis shows an overall good level of engagement by Members of Parliament 
in the decision making processes. There are three groups of MPs who are 
conspicuous in being absent more frequently: senior members of the government, 
MPs not affiliated with any party, and MPs from the left and right fringes of 
the political spectrum. While it is possible to speculate what motivation (or 
lack thereof) drives this behaviour, this is outside the scope of this project.

The analysis also shows that it is possible to predict no-show behaviour with 
some accuracy (in particular in light of the very low prevalence of no-show at
polls), albeit at a significant cost in precision: in other words, a high rate 
of false positives.


## Next steps

Next steps, in terms of this project, will be to drill into more detail of the 
performance of each of the ML algorithms to better understand what opportunities 
might exist to improve their predictive power with this dataset and - in 
parallel - to develop an intuition to help predict which algorithm(s) are most 
likely to deliver a strong result.
 
In parallel, it would be interesting to extend this analysis to probe the 
motivations of MPs for their absences at polls. Sadly, no data on this is
(currently?) provided via abgeordnetenwatch.
